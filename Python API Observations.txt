Data Observations !. One observation I had about the data provided was with the scatterplot comparing city latitude and cloudiness. The plots on the graph almost looked like it was in a certain order/pattern, which is something I would expect when comparing weather statistics with longitude or latitude. Different parts of the world get similar weather, so that was expected. #. My second observation is with the data frames in the WeatherPy file. Some more things that could have been looked at include rainfall, air quality, and even the minimum temperature for the day, as the maximum temperature was accounted for. If I were to go back to this dataset for further research, these are the first few things I would look for. $. My third observation is with hotels data frame. I would want to go back and account for the hotel names in the cities listed, rather than leaving it as an empty column. Hotels/housing would be important to look at when choosing to vacation somewhere, so I would go back and extract the hotel names to include in the data sets.
